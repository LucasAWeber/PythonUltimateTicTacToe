RULES
- Each turn, you mark one of the small squares.
- When you get three in a row on a small board, you’ve won that board.
- To win the game, you need to win three small boards in a row.
- You don’t get to pick which of the nine boards to play on. That’s determined by your opponent’s previous move.
- Whichever square he picks, that’s the board you must play in next. (And whichever square you pick will determine which board he plays on next.)
